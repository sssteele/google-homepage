This is my very first web project. I am following the curriculum on The Odin Project. 
This is a copy of the Google search page without all of the links, just the html and css.
Several things were difficult about this project. The main thing was getting the spacing right.
All of the elements were pretty hard to get spaced correctly. Suprisingly, the easiest part was adding the effects like shadows on hover to the elements.
I think it looks pretty decent except for a few art errors.
